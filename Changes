6/6/2002 - Version 1.1

Added ability to handled data sets with more than one matrix in an input file,
as well as the ability to handle more than one input tree.


8/26/2002  - Version 1.1.1

Removed bug in NNI.c 

9/2002    - Version 1.1.2
Removed bug in main program in print statement called only in verbose mode.

10/1/2002  - Version 1.2
Added ability to simply assign OLS or balanced weights on an input topology,
without doing any NNIs.

11/19/2002 - Version 1.2.1
Fixed parts of newick.c to make it preserve the exact order of the input
topology.

2/28/2003 - Version 1.3
Expanded search of bNNI to retest all edges, rather than only edges adjacent to changed edge.

10/6/2004 - Version 1.4
adding distance estimation capability from sequence data

11/17/2004 - Version 1.4.1 
added ability to handle gapped sequences

12/7/2004 - Version 1.5
added SPR functionality

7/13/2005 Version 1.5.1
adding more protein formulae

8/2005
distance formulae finished

added NJ routine for building initial tree

added *.mat score matrices for scoredist routine
bootstrapped functionality verified
minor change to tree building - nodes in set 'species' are
not used in tree.  This change is to allow bootstrapping to repeatedly
build multiple trees on the same set of nodes.

9/2005
a release version Version 2.0

7/2007
v 2.01
added gamma rate variation
changed gap filter to be pairwise by default
reduced node labels to nine characters at maximum
added capability of sequence input to ignore space characters in sequence

7/19/2007
v 2.02
SPR routine is rewritten, fixed, and a bit faster 
 
9/21/2007
TBR routine written

9/27/2007
TBR.c debugged, CompDist.c and FastDist.c added in to v 2.03

12/12/2007 - Version 2.04
newick.c debugged.
Added BIONJ.c and MVR.c to implement NJ, BIONJ and UNJ algorithms.
Added interface_options.c interface_utilities.c interface_free.c for the
PHYLIP like interface, the command line interface and the man like usage.
Added an extra information file output (_stat.txt).
Formatted the standard and verbose output.
General code structure cleaned, generalization of header files.
Security issue: replaced unsafety functions (strcpy strcmp sprintf) by their
safety equivalent functions (strncpy strncmp snprintf) to avoid buffer overflow.

3/10/2008 - Version 2.05
Removed interface_free.c.
Added p_eigen.c p_lk.c p_models.c p_optimiz.c p_utils.c to integrate
distance computation from protein alignment (heavily borrowed from PhyML).
Replaced discrete gamma law by continous gamma law.

7/18/2008 - Version 2.06
Added p_bootstrap.c to finalize bootstraps (heavily borrowed from PhyML).
Added the boostrap trees output file.
Removed print.c and print.h

1/10/2008 - Version 2.07
Harmonized models global constants and corresponding functions names.
Set default model to F84 for nucleotides and to LG for amino-acids.
Corected option argument error when choosing SCOREDIST model.
